# Romans 14:13-23 — Love That Surrenders Its Rights

**Series**: Romans - The Night Is Far Gone
**Part V**: Walking in Daylight
**Text**: Romans 14:13-23 (ESV)

## Opening: The Cost of Love

We are still walking in daylight.

And we've learned something in these final chapters of Romans: daylight doesn't make everything easier. It makes everything clearer — including the cost of loving one another.

Over the past few weeks in Romans 14, Paul has shown us:

- **Verses 1-4**: Welcome those whom God has received. You are not the Master.
- **Verses 5-9**: Live and die under one Lord. You belong to Christ.
- **Verses 10-12**: You will stand before the judgment seat. You are not the Judge.

Now Paul brings it all to a point. The question is no longer theoretical. It's practical. It's uncomfortable. And it's going to cost you something.

The question is this: *What are you willing to give up for the sake of your brother?*

If you've brought your Bible, open with me to Romans 14:13-23.

## Prayer Transition

Before we read, let me tell you about a people group we're praying for.

[Insert unreached people group of the day]

They need what we take for granted — the freedom that comes from knowing Christ. And they need brothers and sisters who will surrender their own comfort to bring them the gospel.

Let's pray.

## Scripture Reading

Would someone read Romans 14:13-23 for us?

> "Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother. I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean. For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died. So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil. For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men. So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.
>
> Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats. It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble. The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves. But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin."

## Introduction: The Pivot

Verse 13 is a hinge.

Everything before it answered the question: *Who has the right to judge?* Answer: God alone.

Everything after it answers a different question: *How should I use my freedom?* Answer: In love.

Paul has spent twelve verses establishing that you are not the judge and you are not the master. Now he turns to what you *are*: a servant. A brother. One who has been loved at infinite cost — and who is now called to love at personal cost.

This is where Romans 14 gets uncomfortable. Because up to now, you could nod along. *Yes, God is the judge. Yes, we belong to Christ. Yes, every knee will bow.* Amen and amen.

But now Paul says: *So what are you going to do about it?*

## I. Stop Judging, Start Serving (v. 13)

> "Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother."

Notice the shift.

Paul doesn't just say "stop judging." He says "start doing something else instead." He replaces judgment with service. He takes the energy you've been spending on evaluating your brother and redirects it: *Decide never to put a stumbling block in his way.*

The word "decide" is the same Greek word translated "judge" — *krinō*. Paul is making a wordplay. Stop *judging* your brother and start *judging* yourself. Stop rendering verdicts on his choices and start rendering verdicts on your own.

Am I a stumbling block? Am I a hindrance? Am I making it harder for my brother to follow Jesus?

That's a different kind of self-examination. That's not navel-gazing. That's love with eyes open.

A stumbling block — *proskomma* — is something that causes someone to trip and fall. It's not a disagreement. It's not a difference of opinion. It's an obstacle in the path of a brother that could cause him to sin against his own conscience.

And Paul says: make it your mission — *decide* — to never be that obstacle.

## II. Clean, But Not Simple (vv. 14-16)

> "I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean."

This is one of the strongest statements of Christian liberty in the New Testament.

Paul is fully persuaded — there's that word *plērophoreō* again from verse 5 — that no food, no drink, no day is inherently unclean. The ceremonial law has been fulfilled in Christ. The shadows have given way to the substance.

But then comes the qualifier: *but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.*

This is not relativism. Paul is not saying truth depends on your feelings. He's saying *conscience* matters. If a brother believes something is wrong, and he does it anyway, he has sinned — not because the thing itself is sinful, but because he acted against his conscience. He violated his own faith.

The strong brother is right about the food. But if he uses his rightness as a weapon — flaunting his liberty in front of a weaker brother — he has become wrong in a far more serious way.

Verse 15:

> "For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died."

Read that last phrase again: *the one for whom Christ died.*

Christ gave His life for that brother. And you won't give up a meal?

Christ went to the cross for the weak brother whose conscience is troubled. And you can't set aside your freedom for an evening?

Paul is saying: the cost of your liberty is measured against the cost of the cross. And the cross always wins.

Paul told the Corinthians the same thing:

> "But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak... Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ." (1 Corinthians 8:9, 12)

When you wound your brother's conscience, you sin against Christ Himself. That's how seriously God takes this.

Verse 16:

> "So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil."

Your freedom in Christ is good. But if the way you exercise it causes others to speak evil of it — if your liberty becomes a scandal rather than a blessing — then you've misused it. Good things can be spoken of as evil when they're wielded without love.

## III. The Kingdom Redefined (vv. 17-18)

> "For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men."

This might be the most important verse in Romans 14.

The kingdom of God. Not the kingdom of your preferences. Not the kingdom of your convictions about secondary matters. Not the kingdom of your political opinions or your dietary habits or your worship style.

The kingdom of God is:

**Righteousness** — right standing before God, lived out in right conduct before others.

**Peace** — not the absence of disagreement, but the presence of reconciliation. The peace that flows from the cross, where God made peace with us through the blood of Christ.

**Joy in the Holy Spirit** — not happiness that depends on circumstances, but joy that is produced by the Spirit of God dwelling in you. Joy that survives disagreement. Joy that doesn't need everyone to agree with you in order to exist.

This is what the kingdom looks like. Not a food fight. Not a calendar war. Not an argument about who's more spiritual.

Righteousness. Peace. Joy.

If your exercise of liberty produces none of these — if it produces division, bitterness, and resentment instead — then you're not building the kingdom. You're tearing it down.

And here's what the church needs to hear: this applies to every disputable matter in this room. Every argument about schooling choices, political candidates, lifestyle preferences, worship styles — if it's not producing righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, it's not kingdom work. It's flesh work.

Verse 18:

> "Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men."

Serve Christ by pursuing righteousness, peace, and joy — and you will be acceptable to God. Not because you earned it, but because you're living in alignment with what He values.

---

## IV. Build Up, Don't Tear Down (vv. 19-21)

> "So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding."

There's that word "pursue" — *diōkō*. It means to chase, to hunt, to run after. This is not passive. You don't stumble into peace. You don't accidentally build people up.

You pursue it. You chase it. You make it your aim.

> "Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God."

*Destroy the work of God.* Think about that phrase.

God is building something in your brother's life. He's growing faith, deepening trust, producing holiness. And you — with your insistence on exercising your freedom at his expense — could tear that down.

For food. For a meal. For a preference.

The work of God in a brother's soul is worth infinitely more than your right to eat what you want.

> "Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats. It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble."

Paul doesn't back down on the truth: everything is clean. Liberty is real. But liberty must be governed by love.

And here is where the confessions serve us. Our own 1689 Confession says that God alone is Lord of the conscience — and that's true. But conscience doesn't operate in isolation. We live in a body. And the same confession that protects your liberty also calls the church to mutual care and edification. Liberty and love are not enemies. They're partners.

The Reformers understood something many modern Christians have forgotten: freedom is not the right to do whatever you want. Freedom is the power to love without compulsion.

Paul put it most directly to the Galatians:

> "For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another." (Galatians 5:13)

Freedom is for serving. Not for flaunting.

---

## V. Faith and Conscience (vv. 22-23)

> "The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves."

Here is Paul's counsel to the strong: You're right. You have freedom. Now keep it between yourself and God.

You don't need to prove your liberty. You don't need to announce it. You don't need to make a point. You can hold your freedom quietly, joyfully, between you and the Lord who gave it to you.

Blessed is the one who doesn't condemn himself by what he approves. In other words: blessed is the one whose conscience is clear — who exercises freedom in faith, without guilt, without doubt, and without wounding anyone else in the process.

That's the goal: quiet, confident, loving freedom.

> "But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin."

And here is Paul's counsel to the weak: If you have doubts, don't do it.

This is not about the food. It's about the faith. If you eat while doubting — if you act against your conscience — you have sinned. Not because the food is sinful, but because you acted apart from faith.

*Whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.*

That sentence is a plumb line for the Christian life. Every action, every decision, every exercise of freedom must be rooted in faith — in trust in God, in submission to His Word, in confidence that what you're doing honors Him.

When you act from faith, even eating a meal becomes worship.
When you act apart from faith, even a "good" action becomes sin.

This is why Paul has been saying all along: *Be fully convinced in your own mind.* Not because your opinion is ultimate, but because acting without conviction is acting without faith. And acting without faith is sin.

## Pastoral Landing

### To the One Who Loves Being Right More Than Being Loving

You know the truth. You have the right theology. Your position on every disputable matter is correct.

And nobody wants to sit next to you.

Paul would say: you're right about the food. Now stop destroying your brother with it. Your rightness means nothing if it comes without love. The Pharisees were right about a lot of things. And Jesus had His harshest words for them.

"The kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking." It's not a matter of being right. It's a matter of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.

Be right. But be loving first.

### To the One Struggling with Conscience

You hear other Christians talk about their freedom, and you feel guilty — like something is wrong with you for not being there yet.

Nothing is wrong with you. Your conscience is a gift from God. Don't violate it to fit in. Don't act against your convictions because someone else tells you it's fine.

Paul says: if you have doubts, don't do it. That's not weakness. That's wisdom. That's faith protecting itself.

Grow at the pace God grows you. He is patient with you. Be patient with yourself.

### To the One in Recovery — Again

We said it weeks ago, but it bears repeating here: your abstinence is not inferiority. It is faithfulness. And in this passage, Paul gives you even more ground to stand on.

Verse 21: "It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble."

If your sobriety is what keeps you walking with Christ, then your sobriety is *good*. Paul calls it good. Not tolerable. Not a necessary weakness. *Good.*

And if anyone in this room exercises their liberty in a way that threatens your sobriety — bringing alcohol into spaces where they know you're fighting for your life — they are not walking in love. They are putting a stumbling block in your path. And Paul says that's sin.

Your battle is honored here. And the church should be the safest place in your week.

### To the Married Couple Still Fighting Over Secondary Things

"The kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."

Take that sentence home with you. Put it on your refrigerator. Read it before your next argument about the budget, the schedule, the in-laws.

Is this argument producing righteousness? Is it producing peace? Is there any joy in the Holy Spirit coming from this fight?

If not, it's not kingdom work. Set it down. Pursue what makes for peace and mutual upbuilding — starting in your own house.

## Closing: The Freedom That Looks Like Surrender

We are still walking in daylight.

And in the light, love looks different than we expected.

We expected freedom to mean doing whatever we want. Paul says freedom means being free enough to surrender what we want — for the sake of someone else.

Christ had every right. He was Lord of heaven. He was owed worship by every creature. And He surrendered those rights — not grudgingly, not resentfully, but willingly — for you.

That's the freedom Paul is describing. Not freedom *from* your brother. Freedom *for* your brother.

And maybe the prayer we need this week is simply this:

*Lord, help me to hold my rights loosely and my brother tightly.*

The kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking. It's not a matter of who's right and who's wrong on secondary issues. It's a matter of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.

So pursue peace. Build one another up. Keep your faith between yourself and God. And let everything you do proceed from faith.

Whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.

And whatever proceeds from faith — even the surrender of your rights — is worship.

Let's pray.
