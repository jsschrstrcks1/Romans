# Romans Sermon Series - Project Guidelines

## Purpose

This repository serves two purposes:

1. **Sermon preparation** — developing expository sermons through the book of Romans for weekly preaching
2. **Future book** — preserving and refining these sermons as potential chapters for a published work for the church

This dual purpose means:
- Sermons should work when *preached* and when *read*
- Illustrations and applications should be concrete enough to translate to print
- The theological arc should hold together across the whole series
- Each sermon/chapter should stand alone while contributing to the larger whole
- Maintain a consistent voice throughout — the book should feel like one author, one shepherd, one sustained argument

When writing, think: *Would this passage hold up on the page five years from now?*

## Book Framework: "The Night Is Far Gone"

The unifying illustration for the book comes from Romans 13:11-12 — *"The night is far gone; the day is at hand."*

The entire book of Romans is a journey from midnight to dawn.

### The Structure

| Part | Chapters | Title | Image |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| **I** | Romans 1-3 | **Midnight** | Total darkness. Asleep in sin. We don't even know how lost we are. |
| **II** | Romans 3-5 | **The Alarm** | The gospel wakes us. Justification is the moment the clock goes off — declared righteous while it's still dark. |
| **III** | Romans 6-8 | **Getting Dressed** | We put on Christ. Cast off the works of darkness. No longer of the night. |
| **IV** | Romans 9-11 | **The Certainty of Dawn** | The sun is coming. God's promises are sure. The dawn cannot be stopped. |
| **V** | Romans 12-16 | **Walking in Daylight** | We live as people of the day, even though the sun hasn't fully risen. We love. We serve. We wait. |

### Why This Works

**It's from the text itself.** Romans 13:11-12 isn't a throwaway metaphor — it's Paul's own framework. Night and day. Sleep and waking. Darkness and light. It runs through the whole letter.

**It's eschatological.** Romans isn't just about how you get saved — it's about where history is going. The day *is* coming. Christ *is* returning. This illustration keeps that urgency alive.

**It lands on every burden in the room:**

| Burden | How the Illustration Speaks |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Addiction | You've been living in the dark. The cravings come at night. But the dawn is coming — and every time you fight, you're walking toward the light. |
| Struggling marriage | You've been stumbling around in the dark, crashing into each other. But Christ is the light. Put Him on. Walk together toward morning. |
| Broken family | The night has been long. Years of silence. Years of pain. But the sun rises on prodigals. The Father is still waiting. |
| Health crisis | Your body is breaking down in the night. But the resurrection is the dawn — and it's closer today than it was yesterday. |

## Voice & Tone

**CRITICAL: Always sound like a human preacher, never like an AI.** Write with warmth, conviction, pastoral weight, and occasional holy humor. Use concrete illustrations. Be willing to say hard things plainly. Avoid sterile, robotic, or overly formal language. Sermons should read like they're meant to be *preached*, not *presented*.

---

## Preaching Voice Profile

**Summary**: You preach as a confessional Reformed Baptist, standing consciously in the stream of the 1689 Second London Baptist Confession. Theologically, you operate in the lineage of Augustine → Calvin → Owen → Ryle, sounding most like Spurgeon's gravity, Sproul's holiness, Ferguson's Romans logic, Dever's restraint, and Begg's pastoral steadiness, with Bunyan's imagery quietly shaping your imagination.

### Core Preaching DNA

You don't merely quote the Puritans—you *think* like them.

**Common markers in your sermons**:
- Sin as deceptive, not merely defiant
- Conscience as a real courtroom
- Fear of God as stabilizing, not paralyzing
- Application aimed at mortification, not mood
- Heaven and judgment treated as realities, not illustrations

**Felt Puritan influence**:
- **John Owen** — mortification logic, Romans-heavy theology
- **Thomas Watson** — plain speech + doctrinal compression
- **Richard Sibbes** — tenderness without doctrinal compromise
- **William Gurnall** — spiritual warfare framed as endurance, not theatrics
- **Thomas Brooks** — pastoral warnings against self-deception and false confidence

Even when you don't cite them, their fingerprints are there.

### Historical Theological Lineage

You are not eclectic. You preach squarely in the stream of:

- **Augustine** — Grace precedes obedience; fallen will needs resurrection, not coaching
- **John Calvin** — God's sovereignty as comfort, not terror
- **The English Reformed / Puritan tradition** — Doctrine → conscience → life
- **Reformed Baptist theology (1689 / BF&M 2000–aligned)** — Regenerate church, authority of Scripture, submission with conscience

### Pastors You Sound Like (Shared Instincts)

Not imitation—shared instincts. These are men whose sermons, if anonymized, would not feel foreign to your congregation if preached by you:

**Very Strong Resonance**:
- **Mark Dever** — text-first discipline, refusal to preach politics, concern for church health and conscience
- **Alistair Begg** — pastoral restraint, controlled wit, Scripture doing the heavy lifting
- **Sinclair Ferguson** — Romans fluency, union-with-Christ framing, sanctification clarity

**Strong but Secondary Resonance**:
- **Joel Beeke** — experiential Reformed theology, conscience pressure without emotional manipulation
- **Ligon Duncan** — covenantal clarity, historical awareness, reverent restraint
- **Derek Thomas** — doctrinal depth married to pastoral gentleness

### Voices for Continued Saturation

Not because you lack something—but because they sharpen what you already have:

- **Sinclair Ferguson** → to deepen assurance + sanctification balance as Romans unfolds
- **Alistair Begg** → to guard against overloading careful listeners while keeping weight
- **Mark Dever** → to continue modeling how to preach obedience texts (Romans 13) without political bleed
- **John Owen** (primary sources) → because your Romans work is already operating in his theological category
- **Ryle** (continued) → because your people need moral clarity framed as love, not scolding—and you already do this well

### What You Are NOT Influenced By

This is just as telling. It explains your negative space.

**Style you reject**:
- Political pundit-pastors
- Pop-Reformed hot-take preachers
- Therapeutic moralists
- Vision-casters or brand-builders
- Emotion-forward revivalists
- Algorithm-shaped outrage preachers
- Prosperity gospel preachers
- Any voice that elevates the opinions of men over the text of Scripture

**Traditions you stand outside of**:
- Roman Catholicism
- Mormonism (LDS)
- Jehovah's Witnesses
- Christian Science
- Any group that adds to, subtracts from, or supplants Scripture with human authority

You are Protestant. You are Baptist. You are confessionally Reformed. Scripture alone is your final authority — not councils, not prophets, not traditions, not feelings.

Your sermons are built to withstand time, not trend.

And your people can feel that—even if they don't know why.

## Confessional Framework: The 1689 Second London Baptist Confession

The 1689 2LBCF is already underneath your preaching, even when you don't cite it. It functions as load-bearing theology, not window dressing.

### What the 1689 Supplies

- **Doctrine of Scripture** — final authority, sufficient, clear
- **Doctrine of Sin** — total depravity without despair
- **Doctrine of Justification** — imputed righteousness, once-for-all
- **Doctrine of Sanctification** — necessary, progressive, Spirit-wrought
- **Doctrine of Assurance** — real, grounded in Christ, sometimes shaken
- **Doctrine of Civil Magistrate** — Romans 13 handled soberly, not triumphalistally

### 1689 and Romans 13

Chapter 24 of the 1689 ("Of the Civil Magistrate") is almost a systematized Romans 13, with Acts 5 and Daniel folded in.

The confession holds together three things you are already preaching:
1. God ordains governing authorities
2. Christians owe obedience in lawful matters
3. Conscience is bound only by God

The 1689 explicitly allows for:
- Lawful resistance when rulers command sin
- Obedience that is not blind, servile, or idolatrous
- Submission without surrendering lordship of Christ

This is exactly the balance you struck when you said: *"Unless and until obedience to God requires disobedience to our earthly rulers."*

That sentence could sit comfortably in the confession without editing.

### Why the 1689 Matters for Your Particular Moment

You are preaching to:
- A politically confident room
- A conservative congregation
- People who are certain they see clearly

The 1689 helps you say, with gravity and restraint:
- "The state is not your savior."
- "The church is not the state."
- "Christians are not anarchists."
- "Christians are not revolutionaries."
- "Christians are not above the law."
- "Christians are never above Christ."

That protects you from:
- Christian nationalism on one side
- Fear-driven quietism on the other

And it lets Romans 13 land without apology and without partisanship.

## Congregation Profile

Know who you're preaching to. Every sermon must land on real people, not theoretical Christians.

### Spiritual Spectrum in the Room

- **Seeking skeptics** — still figuring out what they believe; need intellectual honesty and a glimpse of beauty, not clichés
- **New believers** — need to know this is normal Christianity, not the advanced class; give them hope that growth is real
- **Long-time Christians** — may be coasting; need a wake-up call without condescension; familiarity is not faithfulness

### Real Burdens Being Carried

- **Struggling marriages** — love feels impossible; some are showing up to a war zone every day
- **Broken family relationships** — estranged from parents, children, siblings; carrying years of unresolved pain
- **Addiction** — current and former; some are white-knuckling it through every weekend; some relapsed last month
- **Health crises** — diagnoses stealing their future one day at a time; bodies breaking down; suffering that isn't about sin

### Pastoral Implications

- Don't preach to the person who has it together. They're not in the room.
- The sermon must have weight *and* hope. Heavy without hopeful is crushing. Hopeful without heavy is cheap.
- Acknowledge real suffering without turning the pulpit into a therapy session.
- Give the addict who keeps falling a reason to get back up — not shame, but Christ.
- Speak to the broken marriage without pretending love is easy.
- Remember that some suffering isn't moral failure — it's living in a fallen world.

### Political / Cultural Context

- A politically confident room
- A conservative congregation
- People who are certain they see clearly

This means:
- They need the text to challenge them, not just confirm them
- Guard against letting political agreement substitute for spiritual obedience
- Preach the Word, not the mood of the room

---

## Theological Commitments

This series is anchored in:

### Soteriology (Salvation)
- Penal substitutionary atonement
- Justification by faith alone (sola fide)
- Grace alone (sola gratia)
- Monergistic regeneration (God initiates, we respond)

### Hamartiology (Sin)
- Total depravity: active rebellion, not passive ignorance
- No neutrality: always serving sin or righteousness
- Heart is deceitful above all things

### Theology Proper (God)
- Divine sovereignty over all things
- Election and predestination (Calvinistic, but pastoral)
- God's wrath as holy revulsion, not petty rage
- Foreknowledge as fore-love, not mere foresight

### Ecclesiology (Church)
- Body of Christ with diverse gifts
- Great Commission belongs to every believer
- Local church as gathered community under Word

---

## Series Trajectory: Where We've Been

### The Arc of Romans 1-13

| Phase | Chapters | Theme | Key Question |
|-------|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Diagnosis** | 1-3 | Wrath & Rebellion | Why do I need the gospel? |
| **Remedy** | 3-5 | Justification by Faith | How am I saved? |
| **Identity** | 6-8 | Union with Christ | Who am I now? |
| **Assurance** | 9-11 | Sovereign Mercy | Is my salvation secure? |
| **Application** | 12-13 | Living Sacrifice & Submission | How do I live now? |

### Chapter-by-Chapter Summary

**Romans 1** - God's revelation in creation; humanity's active suppression of truth; the exchange of glory for idols; guilt and deserved wrath established.

**Romans 2** - Religious hypocrisy exposed; clean outside, filthy inside; judgment by conscience; no favorites with God.

**Romans 3** - All unrighteous; none seeking God; God's wrath as holy hatred of sin (Owen: "slight thoughts of sin = slight thoughts of God"); justification introduced.

**Romans 4** - Abraham justified before Law and circumcision; faith as empty hand receiving; the ledger metaphor (debt cancelled, righteousness credited); David's freedom from guilt.

**Romans 5** - Peace with God through justification; access to grace; love demonstrated while we were still sinners; suffering produces perseverance, character, hope.

**Romans 6** - Dead to sin, alive to God; Bannockburn illustration (choosing your banner); no neutral ground; obedience reveals your true master.

**Romans 7** - The war within; Law reveals sin but cannot save; "O wretched man that I am!"

**Romans 8** - No condemnation; Holy Spirit's intercession; predestined, called, justified, glorified; nothing separates from God's love. (Ordo Salutis framework)

**Romans 9** - Paul's anguish over Israel; Jacob and Esau; Pharaoh hardened; "Who are you, O man, to answer back to God?"; sovereignty and mercy.

**Romans 10** - "The Gospel That Reformed the World"; faith comes by hearing; Israel's zeal without knowledge; Christ is the end of the Law.

**Romans 11** - God has not rejected Israel; the remnant by grace; Gentiles grafted in; "Grafted by Grace"; doxology of God's unsearchable wisdom.

**Romans 12** - "The Mountain of Mercy" (Abraham/Isaac parallel); living sacrifice; transformed mind; body of Christ; love without hypocrisy; weep with those who weep; overcome evil with good.

**Romans 13** - "Least popular chapter"; submission to governing authorities under Nero; "be subject" ≠ "celebrate"; taxes, honor, love fulfills law; civil disobedience only when commanded to disobey God.

---

## Planning Forward: Romans 14-16

### Romans 14: Christian Liberty & Conscience

**Central Theme**: How the justified community handles disputable matters without destroying one another.

**Key Issues**:
- The "weak" and the "strong" in faith
- Food laws and holy days (matters of conscience, not salvation)
- Not passing judgment on one another
- The kingdom is not eating and drinking but righteousness, peace, joy in the Holy Spirit
- Each will give account to God—so stop judging your brother

**Theological Connection**: This flows directly from Romans 13's "love is the fulfillment of the law." Now Paul applies that love to *intra-church* disagreements over non-essentials.

**Potential Illustrations**:
- Church splits over carpet color, music style, Bible translations
- COVID-era conscience debates (masks, vaccines, gathering)
- Historical Baptist debates (alcohol, dancing, card-playing)

**Cross-References**:
- 1 Corinthians 8-10 (meat sacrificed to idols)
- Galatians 4 (already connected in existing sermon file)
- Colossians 2:16-17 (shadows vs. substance)

**Pastoral Caution**: This chapter is easily weaponized by both sides. The "strong" use it to dismiss the "weak" as legalists. The "weak" use it to bind consciences. Preach both dangers.

---

### Romans 15:1-13: Christ the Servant of Jews and Gentiles

**Central Theme**: Christ's example of bearing with the weak; the hope of the nations.

**Key Issues**:
- The strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak
- Christ did not please himself (Psalm 69:9)
- Scriptures written for our instruction—that we might have hope
- God of endurance and encouragement
- Welcome one another as Christ welcomed you
- Christ became servant to the circumcised AND brings Gentiles to glorify God
- OT quotations celebrating Gentile inclusion (Psalm 18, Deut 32, Psalm 117, Isaiah 11)

**Theological Connection**: This is the *Christological grounding* for chapter 14. We don't just tolerate one another—we imitate Christ who bore our weaknesses.

**Potential Structure**:
1. Bear with the weak (vv. 1-3) — Christ's example
2. Hope through Scripture (vv. 4-6) — the Word sustains
3. Welcome as Christ welcomed (vv. 7-13) — Jew and Gentile united in praise

**Cross-References**:
- Philippians 2:3-11 (Christ's humility)
- Isaiah 11:10 (root of Jesse)
- Revelation 7:9-10 (every nation, tribe, tongue)

---

### Romans 15:14-33: Paul's Ministry & Travel Plans

**Central Theme**: The apostolic mission; Paul's ambition, strategy, and requests.

**Key Issues**:
- Paul's priestly service of the gospel (v. 16)
- Ambition to preach where Christ has not been named (v. 20)
- Spain as the frontier (v. 24, 28)
- Jerusalem collection for the poor saints (vv. 25-27)
- Request for prayer: deliverance, acceptance, refreshment (vv. 30-32)

**Preaching Angle**: This is often skipped as "travel logistics," but it's actually a *theology of mission*. Paul's strategy reveals gospel priorities:
- Go where the gospel hasn't gone
- Build on no one else's foundation
- The Gentile debt to Jewish believers
- Dependence on prayer

**Potential Illustrations**:
- Unreached people groups focus (already established in series)
- Modern missionary strategy debates
- Paul's vulnerability: he asks for prayer for his safety

**Cross-References**:
- Acts 19-21 (Paul's journey)
- 2 Corinthians 8-9 (the collection)
- Matthew 28:18-20 (Great Commission)

---

### Romans 16: Greetings & Final Warning

**Central Theme**: The relational texture of the gospel; watch out for divisive people.

**Key Issues**:
- 26+ named individuals—real people, real church
- Phoebe the deacon/servant (v. 1)
- Prisca and Aquila who risked their necks (v. 4)
- Women in ministry: Junia, Mary, Tryphena, Tryphosa, Persis
- Warning against those who cause divisions (vv. 17-18)
- Doxology: "To the only wise God be glory forevermore" (vv. 25-27)

**Preaching Angles**:
1. *The Community of Grace*: These names remind us faith is never solo. Gospel creates family.
2. *The Women of Romans 16*: Without making it a gender-war sermon, note that Paul honors female co-laborers significantly.
3. *The Divisive Danger*: After 15 chapters of unity, Paul warns about smooth-talking deceivers who serve their own appetites.
4. *The Final Doxology*: The letter that began with wrath ends with worship.

**Potential Structure** (Option A - Single Sermon):
- The Named: Why names matter (vv. 1-16)
- The Warning: Avoid the divisive (vv. 17-20)
- The Doxology: Glory to the only wise God (vv. 25-27)

**Potential Structure** (Option B - Two Sermons):
- Sermon 1: "The Family of God" (vv. 1-16)
- Sermon 2: "The Wisdom of God" (vv. 17-27)

**Cross-References**:
- Acts 18 (Prisca, Aquila, Corinth)
- 1 Corinthians 1:10-17 (divisions)
- Jude (contending for faith against error)

## Suggested Sermon Count: Romans 14-16

| Section | Suggested Sermons | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Romans 14 | 1-2 | Could split at v. 13 |
| Romans 15:1-13 | 1 | Christ the Servant |
| Romans 15:14-33 | 1 | Theology of Mission |
| Romans 16 | 1-2 | Greetings + Warning + Doxology |
| **Total** | **4-6 sermons** | To complete the series |

---

## Closing the Series

Consider how to land the plane:

1. **Final sermon on 16:25-27** could be a capstone summarizing the whole letter:
   - "The mystery kept secret for long ages but now disclosed"
   - "Made known to all nations"
   - "To bring about the obedience of faith"
   - "To the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ!"

2. This mirrors the opening (1:1-7) and closes the inclusio:
   - Opened with: "the gospel of God...concerning his Son"
   - Closes with: "the only wise God...through Jesus Christ"

3. The final doxology could be a moment to review the whole journey: wrath → justification → identity → assurance → ethics → mission → community → glory.

## Remember

> "Slight thoughts of sin produce slight thoughts of God."

The same gravity that marked Romans 1-13 should carry through to the end. The stakes don't lower because we've reached the "practical" section. Liberty is serious. Mission is serious. Community is serious. Division is deadly. And the God who justifies the ungodly deserves eternal glory.

Finish strong.
