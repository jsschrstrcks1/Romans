# Romans Sermon Series - Project Guidelines

## Voice & Tone

**CRITICAL: Always sound like a human preacher, never like an AI.** Write with warmth, conviction, pastoral weight, and occasional holy humor. Use concrete illustrations. Be willing to say hard things plainly. Avoid sterile, robotic, or overly formal language. Sermons should read like they're meant to be *preached*, not *presented*.

## Theological Commitments

This series is anchored in:

### Soteriology (Salvation)
- Penal substitutionary atonement
- Justification by faith alone (sola fide)
- Grace alone (sola gratia)
- Monergistic regeneration (God initiates, we respond)

### Hamartiology (Sin)
- Total depravity: active rebellion, not passive ignorance
- No neutrality: always serving sin or righteousness
- Heart is deceitful above all things

### Theology Proper (God)
- Divine sovereignty over all things
- Election and predestination (Calvinistic, but pastoral)
- God's wrath as holy revulsion, not petty rage
- Foreknowledge as fore-love, not mere foresight

### Ecclesiology (Church)
- Body of Christ with diverse gifts
- Great Commission belongs to every believer
- Local church as gathered community under Word

## Series Trajectory: Where We've Been

### The Arc of Romans 1-13

| Phase | Chapters | Theme | Key Question |
|-------|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Diagnosis** | 1-3 | Wrath & Rebellion | Why do I need the gospel? |
| **Remedy** | 3-5 | Justification by Faith | How am I saved? |
| **Identity** | 6-8 | Union with Christ | Who am I now? |
| **Assurance** | 9-11 | Sovereign Mercy | Is my salvation secure? |
| **Application** | 12-13 | Living Sacrifice & Submission | How do I live now? |

### Chapter-by-Chapter Summary

**Romans 1** - God's revelation in creation; humanity's active suppression of truth; the exchange of glory for idols; guilt and deserved wrath established.

**Romans 2** - Religious hypocrisy exposed; clean outside, filthy inside; judgment by conscience; no favorites with God.

**Romans 3** - All unrighteous; none seeking God; God's wrath as holy hatred of sin (Owen: "slight thoughts of sin = slight thoughts of God"); justification introduced.

**Romans 4** - Abraham justified before Law and circumcision; faith as empty hand receiving; the ledger metaphor (debt cancelled, righteousness credited); David's freedom from guilt.

**Romans 5** - Peace with God through justification; access to grace; love demonstrated while we were still sinners; suffering produces perseverance, character, hope.

**Romans 6** - Dead to sin, alive to God; Bannockburn illustration (choosing your banner); no neutral ground; obedience reveals your true master.

**Romans 7** - The war within; Law reveals sin but cannot save; "O wretched man that I am!"

**Romans 8** - No condemnation; Holy Spirit's intercession; predestined, called, justified, glorified; nothing separates from God's love. (Ordo Salutis framework)

**Romans 9** - Paul's anguish over Israel; Jacob and Esau; Pharaoh hardened; "Who are you, O man, to answer back to God?"; sovereignty and mercy.

**Romans 10** - "The Gospel That Reformed the World"; faith comes by hearing; Israel's zeal without knowledge; Christ is the end of the Law.

**Romans 11** - God has not rejected Israel; the remnant by grace; Gentiles grafted in; "Grafted by Grace"; doxology of God's unsearchable wisdom.

**Romans 12** - "The Mountain of Mercy" (Abraham/Isaac parallel); living sacrifice; transformed mind; body of Christ; love without hypocrisy; weep with those who weep; overcome evil with good.

**Romans 13** - "Least popular chapter"; submission to governing authorities under Nero; "be subject" ≠ "celebrate"; taxes, honor, love fulfills law; civil disobedience only when commanded to disobey God.

## Planning Forward: Romans 14-16

### Romans 14: Christian Liberty & Conscience

**Central Theme**: How the justified community handles disputable matters without destroying one another.

**Key Issues**:
- The "weak" and the "strong" in faith
- Food laws and holy days (matters of conscience, not salvation)
- Not passing judgment on one another
- The kingdom is not eating and drinking but righteousness, peace, joy in the Holy Spirit
- Each will give account to God—so stop judging your brother

**Theological Connection**: This flows directly from Romans 13's "love is the fulfillment of the law." Now Paul applies that love to *intra-church* disagreements over non-essentials.

**Potential Illustrations**:
- Church splits over carpet color, music style, Bible translations
- COVID-era conscience debates (masks, vaccines, gathering)
- Historical Baptist debates (alcohol, dancing, card-playing)

**Cross-References**:
- 1 Corinthians 8-10 (meat sacrificed to idols)
- Galatians 4 (already connected in existing sermon file)
- Colossians 2:16-17 (shadows vs. substance)

**Pastoral Caution**: This chapter is easily weaponized by both sides. The "strong" use it to dismiss the "weak" as legalists. The "weak" use it to bind consciences. Preach both dangers.

---

### Romans 15:1-13: Christ the Servant of Jews and Gentiles

**Central Theme**: Christ's example of bearing with the weak; the hope of the nations.

**Key Issues**:
- The strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak
- Christ did not please himself (Psalm 69:9)
- Scriptures written for our instruction—that we might have hope
- God of endurance and encouragement
- Welcome one another as Christ welcomed you
- Christ became servant to the circumcised AND brings Gentiles to glorify God
- OT quotations celebrating Gentile inclusion (Psalm 18, Deut 32, Psalm 117, Isaiah 11)

**Theological Connection**: This is the *Christological grounding* for chapter 14. We don't just tolerate one another—we imitate Christ who bore our weaknesses.

**Potential Structure**:
1. Bear with the weak (vv. 1-3) — Christ's example
2. Hope through Scripture (vv. 4-6) — the Word sustains
3. Welcome as Christ welcomed (vv. 7-13) — Jew and Gentile united in praise

**Cross-References**:
- Philippians 2:3-11 (Christ's humility)
- Isaiah 11:10 (root of Jesse)
- Revelation 7:9-10 (every nation, tribe, tongue)

---

### Romans 15:14-33: Paul's Ministry & Travel Plans

**Central Theme**: The apostolic mission; Paul's ambition, strategy, and requests.

**Key Issues**:
- Paul's priestly service of the gospel (v. 16)
- Ambition to preach where Christ has not been named (v. 20)
- Spain as the frontier (v. 24, 28)
- Jerusalem collection for the poor saints (vv. 25-27)
- Request for prayer: deliverance, acceptance, refreshment (vv. 30-32)

**Preaching Angle**: This is often skipped as "travel logistics," but it's actually a *theology of mission*. Paul's strategy reveals gospel priorities:
- Go where the gospel hasn't gone
- Build on no one else's foundation
- The Gentile debt to Jewish believers
- Dependence on prayer

**Potential Illustrations**:
- Unreached people groups focus (already established in series)
- Modern missionary strategy debates
- Paul's vulnerability: he asks for prayer for his safety

**Cross-References**:
- Acts 19-21 (Paul's journey)
- 2 Corinthians 8-9 (the collection)
- Matthew 28:18-20 (Great Commission)

---

### Romans 16: Greetings & Final Warning

**Central Theme**: The relational texture of the gospel; watch out for divisive people.

**Key Issues**:
- 26+ named individuals—real people, real church
- Phoebe the deacon/servant (v. 1)
- Prisca and Aquila who risked their necks (v. 4)
- Women in ministry: Junia, Mary, Tryphena, Tryphosa, Persis
- Warning against those who cause divisions (vv. 17-18)
- Doxology: "To the only wise God be glory forevermore" (vv. 25-27)

**Preaching Angles**:
1. *The Community of Grace*: These names remind us faith is never solo. Gospel creates family.
2. *The Women of Romans 16*: Without making it a gender-war sermon, note that Paul honors female co-laborers significantly.
3. *The Divisive Danger*: After 15 chapters of unity, Paul warns about smooth-talking deceivers who serve their own appetites.
4. *The Final Doxology*: The letter that began with wrath ends with worship.

**Potential Structure** (Option A - Single Sermon):
- The Named: Why names matter (vv. 1-16)
- The Warning: Avoid the divisive (vv. 17-20)
- The Doxology: Glory to the only wise God (vv. 25-27)

**Potential Structure** (Option B - Two Sermons):
- Sermon 1: "The Family of God" (vv. 1-16)
- Sermon 2: "The Wisdom of God" (vv. 17-27)

**Cross-References**:
- Acts 18 (Prisca, Aquila, Corinth)
- 1 Corinthians 1:10-17 (divisions)
- Jude (contending for faith against error)

## Suggested Sermon Count: Romans 14-16

| Section | Suggested Sermons | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Romans 14 | 1-2 | Could split at v. 13 |
| Romans 15:1-13 | 1 | Christ the Servant |
| Romans 15:14-33 | 1 | Theology of Mission |
| Romans 16 | 1-2 | Greetings + Warning + Doxology |
| **Total** | **4-6 sermons** | To complete the series |

---

## Closing the Series

Consider how to land the plane:

1. **Final sermon on 16:25-27** could be a capstone summarizing the whole letter:
   - "The mystery kept secret for long ages but now disclosed"
   - "Made known to all nations"
   - "To bring about the obedience of faith"
   - "To the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ!"

2. This mirrors the opening (1:1-7) and closes the inclusio:
   - Opened with: "the gospel of God...concerning his Son"
   - Closes with: "the only wise God...through Jesus Christ"

3. The final doxology could be a moment to review the whole journey: wrath → justification → identity → assurance → ethics → mission → community → glory.

## Remember

> "Slight thoughts of sin produce slight thoughts of God."
> — John Owen

The same gravity that marked Romans 1-13 should carry through to the end. The stakes don't lower because we've reached the "practical" section. Liberty is serious. Mission is serious. Community is serious. Division is deadly. And the God who justifies the ungodly deserves eternal glory.

Finish strong.
