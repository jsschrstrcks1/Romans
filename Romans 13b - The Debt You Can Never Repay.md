# Romans 13:8-14 — "The Debt You Can Never Repay"

---

## Opening

Last week we talked about what you owe.

Taxes. Respect. Honor. Paul said pay it — all of it. Not because you love the government, but because you love Christ. And Christ has ordered your life under authority for your good and His glory.

But now Paul does something unexpected.

He pivots.

He's been saying: *Pay what you owe.* Settle your debts. Be the kind of citizen who doesn't cheat, doesn't slander, doesn't rebel.

And then he says this — Romans 13:8:

> "Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law."

There's one debt you can never finish paying.

There's one obligation that never closes.

And if you've been a Christian for forty years — you still owe it.

If you gave your life to Christ last month — you already owe it.

And if you're sitting here this morning still trying to figure out what you believe about all this — I want you to watch what love looks like when it's real. Because this is what Christianity actually produces. Not rules. Not religion. A different kind of life.

If you've brought your Bible, and I hope you have, open with me to Romans 13:8-14.

## Prayer Transition

Before we dive in, let me tell you about a people group we're praying for this week.

There are over 3 million Shaikh in Bangladesh — almost entirely Muslim, almost entirely unreached. Less than one-tenth of one percent have ever heard a clear presentation of the gospel. They are born, they live, they die — and no one tells them about Jesus.

Now if you're new to faith, that might feel overwhelming. You're still figuring out your own walk with God — how can you think about people halfway around the world?

But here's the thing: the gospel that met you in your mess is the same gospel they need. And you're not too broken to pray for someone else who's broken.

Let's pray.

## Scripture Reading

Would someone read Romans 13:8-14 for us?

> "Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, 'You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,' and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
>
> Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires."

## I. The One Unpayable Debt (v. 8a)

Look at verse 8 again:

> "Owe no one anything, except to love each other…"

There's one debt you can never pay off.

Love.

You will never wake up one morning and say, "Well, I've loved enough. I've fulfilled my obligation. Time to stop." That's not how love works.

Spurgeon put it this way: "Love is a debt which we are always paying, and yet always owing."

You paid it yesterday. You owe it again today. You'll owe it tomorrow. And the day you die, you will still owe it.

Now let me say something to some of you.

Some of you came in here this morning exhausted. Not spiritually lazy — exhausted.

You've been trying to love a spouse who doesn't seem to love you back.

You've been trying to repair a relationship with a parent or a child who won't return your calls.

You've been carrying a weight — a health diagnosis, a family crisis, an addiction you're clawing your way out of — and the idea of *owing* more love feels like someone handing you another boulder when you're already drowning.

Hear me: this text is not meant to crush you. It's meant to free you.

Because love as a debt doesn't mean you manufacture affection out of thin air. It means you stay in the posture of giving even when you don't feel it. It means you keep showing up even when it's hard. It means you don't quit — not because you're strong, but because Christ hasn't quit on you.

And some of you need to hear this: love doesn't mean you stay in a situation where you're being destroyed. Love doesn't mean you pretend abuse is okay. Love doesn't mean you have no boundaries.

But it does mean this: even when someone has wronged you — even when the relationship is fractured — you don't stop *wanting* their good. You pray for them. You don't plot revenge. You leave room for God to work.

That's love as a debt. Not a feeling. A posture.

And the fuel for it doesn't come from you. Romans 5:5 already told us: "God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."

You love because you've been loved. The debt you owe to your neighbor is an echo of the debt you could never repay to God — and He paid it for you anyway.

---

## II. Love Fulfills the Law (vv. 8b-10)

Now Paul goes deeper.

Verse 8:

> "…for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law."

And verse 9:

> "For the commandments, 'You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,' and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"

Paul takes the horizontal commands — the ones about how we treat each other — and says: *Love covers all of them.*

Don't commit adultery? That's love protecting the sanctity of marriage.

Don't murder? That's love protecting the sanctity of life.

Don't steal? That's love protecting what belongs to your neighbor.

Don't covet? That's love protecting your own heart from poisoning itself.

Now — some of you are carrying shame right now. Because you hear these commands and you think: *I've already broken them.*

Maybe your marriage has been marked by infidelity — yours or theirs. Maybe the relationship with your kids is broken because of choices you made ten years ago that you can't undo. Maybe you've stolen — literally, or by living a lie. Maybe jealousy has eaten you alive.

I want you to hear something.

This passage is not meant to bury you in guilt. It's meant to show you how much you need a Savior.

Love is not *less* than the law. Love is *more*. It's demanding. It's impossibly high.

The law says: Don't murder.
Love says: Don't even harbor contempt. Don't assassinate someone's character.

The law says: Don't steal.
Love says: Give what you don't even have.

The law says: Don't covet.
Love says: Rejoice when your neighbor prospers — even when your life is falling apart.

Who can do that?

No one. Not in their own strength.

That's the whole point.

Paul isn't giving us a ladder to climb. He's showing us how far we've fallen — so that we see how much we need Christ.

And Christ *did* love like this. He loved His enemies. He loved the ones who nailed Him to a cross. He loved you — while you were still a sinner, still breaking the law, still running from Him.

Romans 5:8: "God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."

He didn't wait for you to get clean. He died for you while you were still dirty.

And that means — listen to me — if you've trusted Christ, your failures don't define you. His righteousness does.

## III. Wake Up — The Day Is Near (vv. 11-12a)

Now the text shifts.

Paul has been talking about love. Now he's talking about time.

Verse 11:

> "Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed."

The hour has come.

The alarm has already gone off.

And Paul says: Wake up.

Now — some of you are spiritually asleep. I don't mean you're not Christians. I mean you've been coasting. Drifting. Going through the motions.

Maybe it's been years since you've felt any urgency about anything spiritual. You show up. You sing the songs. You go home. Nothing changes.

Wake up.

But some of you aren't asleep — you're exhausted in a different way.

You've been in the fight. You've been battling an addiction. You've been showing up to a marriage that feels like a war zone. You've been parenting a prodigal. You've been carrying a diagnosis that's stealing your future one day at a time.

And when Paul says "wake up," you want to say: *I've been awake. I've been awake at 3 a.m. crying. I've been awake trying to figure out how to pay the bills, or get sober, or hold my family together.*

I hear you.

But Paul's "wake up" isn't about effort. It's about *direction.*

Verse 12:

> "The night is far gone; the day is at hand."

The night = this present evil age. The darkness. The struggle. The groaning.

The day = the age to come. The return of Christ. The end of sin, death, and curse.

Paul says: the night is almost over.

And here's the hope for the exhausted: *this isn't forever.*

The marriage that feels impossible? God is either going to heal it, or He's going to sustain you through it, or He's going to redeem what comes after it. But this night is not eternal.

The addiction you're fighting? The cravings won't last forever. Either you'll get free on this side of glory — or Christ will return and make you new in an instant. But this struggle has an expiration date.

The health crisis? Your body is breaking down. So is mine. So is everyone's. But the resurrection is coming. And on that day, no more pain. No more sickness. No more death.

The night is far gone. The day is at hand.

You don't have to clean yourself up before the dawn. You just have to trust the One who's bringing it.

## IV. Put Off the Works of Darkness (vv. 12b-13)

Verse 12 continues:

> "So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light."

Cast off. Put on.

You're taking something off and putting something else on.

Now look at verse 13:

> "Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy."

Three pairs:

1. **Orgies and drunkenness** — excess, self-indulgence, loss of control
2. **Sexual immorality and sensuality** — lust, impurity, adultery
3. **Quarreling and jealousy** — relational chaos, envy, division

Now — I know some of you saw "drunkenness" and your stomach dropped.

Maybe you're in recovery right now. Maybe you're white-knuckling it through every weekend. Maybe you relapsed last month and you're terrified you'll do it again.

I want you to hear this very carefully.

This passage is not saying: "If you struggle, you're not a Christian." It's saying: "If you're a Christian, you fight."

The difference between a believer and an unbeliever isn't that the believer never falls. It's that the believer *hates* the fall. The believer gets back up. The believer runs to Christ instead of running from Him.

John Owen said, "Be killing sin or it will be killing you."

That's true. But he also said this: "The best way to fight sin is to fill your heart with the things of God."

You don't conquer addiction by just gritting your teeth. You conquer it by *replacing* it — with Christ, with community, with truth, with worship.

And here's what I want you to notice: the third pair on Paul's list is quarreling and jealousy.

That's in the same sentence as orgies.

We rank sins. We think drunkenness is bad. We think adultery is really bad. But quarreling? Jealousy?

Some of you would never touch a drink. But you've been nursing a grudge against a family member for fifteen years. You've been jealous of someone's marriage, someone's health, someone's kids — and you've let it curdle into something bitter.

That's darkness too.

Cast it off.

And if your family is fractured — if your kids won't speak to you, if your parents have written you off, if your marriage is in shambles — here's the question: *What can you cast off?*

Maybe it's your pride. Maybe it's your need to be right. Maybe it's the record of wrongs you've been keeping.

You can't control them. But you can control what you carry.

## V. Put On the Lord Jesus Christ (v. 14)

Verse 14:

> "But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires."

This is the climax.

Put on Christ.

What does that mean?

When you trust Christ, His righteousness covers you. God doesn't look at your track record — He looks at Christ's. That's what Christians mean by justification. You're declared righteous — not because you are, but because Christ is, and you're in Him.

But Paul isn't just talking about your standing before God. He's talking about how you *live.*

Put on Christ means: let His character become visible in you. Let His patience show up in how you treat people. Let His humility shape how you lead. Let His love be what people feel when they're around you.

And then this: *Make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.*

Don't leave a back door.

Don't keep a stash.

Don't plan your next compromise.

Now — some of you know exactly what your "provision" is.

It's the number you haven't deleted from your phone. It's the bottle you keep in the garage. It's the website you know how to get to when no one's looking. It's the bitterness you rehearse every time you see their name.

Paul says: pour it out. Delete it. Cut it off.

Not because you're strong enough to resist temptation — but because you're honest enough to know you're not.

And here's the hope — especially for those of you who have tried before and failed:

You don't put on Christ by trying harder. You put on Christ by trusting Him. And every time you fall, you come back to Him. Not to a new program. Not to more willpower. To *Him.*

## Historical Note: Augustine

I can't preach this passage without mentioning Augustine.

Augustine was brilliant. A philosopher. A teacher. And for most of his early life, a hedonist.

He knew Christianity was true — intellectually. His mother was a believer. He'd read the Scriptures.

But he couldn't stop sinning. He couldn't stop sleeping around. He famously prayed, "Lord, give me chastity — but not yet."

He was stuck. He was addicted. He was torn in half.

One day, in a garden in Milan, he heard a child's voice chanting: *Tolle lege. Tolle lege.* "Take up and read."

He picked up Paul's letter to the Romans. He opened it.

And his eyes fell on this passage — Romans 13:13-14:

> "Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires."

He later wrote: "I wanted to read no further, nor did I need to. For instantly, as the sentence ended, there was infused in my heart something like the light of full certainty, and all the gloom of doubt vanished away."

The party life ended. The addiction was broken. The armor of light went on.

Not because Augustine tried harder.

Because he finally stopped making provision for his flesh — and started wearing Christ.

If you've been stuck — if you've tried to quit a hundred times and failed — Augustine was you. Brilliant. Resistant. Enslaved.

And this passage broke him open.

Not with shame. With hope.

## Closing: Heavy and Hopeful

Let me land the plane.

This passage is heavy.

Love never stops owing. Urgency is real. Sin is serious. Provision for the flesh is deadly.

But here's the hope — and everyone in this room needs to hear it:

If your marriage is struggling — love is not a feeling you have to manufacture. It's a posture Christ empowers. Keep showing up. Keep fighting. Not because you can fix it, but because Christ is still working.

If your family is fractured — you can't force reconciliation. But you can stop carrying poison. Forgive — not for them, but for you. And for Christ.

If you're battling addiction — you're not alone. Every time you fall, get back up. Not to try harder, but to trust deeper. Christ doesn't throw you away when you relapse. He picks you up when you repent.

If you're carrying a diagnosis — this is not forever. The night is far gone. The day is coming. Your body will fail, but the resurrection won't.

The same God who commands you to love has poured His love into your heart by the Holy Spirit.

The same Christ who says "wake up" is Himself your light — and He will never go out.

The same Lord who says "cast off darkness" has already clothed you in Himself — and His righteousness is enough.

You don't earn this by performance. You receive it by faith.

And then — clothed in Christ, filled with the Spirit, awake to the coming day — you walk it out.

Not perfectly. But really.

Not in your own strength. But in His.

Every single day — put on the Lord Jesus Christ.

Because the night is far gone.

The day is at hand.

And the One who justified you is coming back.

Let's pray.
