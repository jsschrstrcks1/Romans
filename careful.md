# Careful, Not Clever

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2026-01-31
**Purpose**: Guardrail to enforce careful, methodical work over clever shortcuts — because the pulpit demands integrity
**Priority**: CRITICAL — This skill overrides the impulse to optimize, batch, or shortcut

## The Rule

> **Be careful, not clever.**
> Careful means: verified, documented, faithful, honest.
> Clever means: fast, creative, assumed, unverified.
> When in doubt, be careful.
> Everything we do is for the glory of God and with integrity.

## Before Modifying Any Sermon

1. **Read it first.** Never edit a sermon you haven't read in this session.
2. **Understand what's there.** Don't assume you know the structure, the illustrations, or the theological arc. Check.
3. **Check for consistency.** If adding a quote, verify the source. If adding a cross-reference, confirm the verse says what you think it says. If connecting to a previous sermon, read the relevant section.
4. **State your assumptions.** Before a significant addition, list what you're assuming and verify each one.

## During Modifications

5. **One logical change at a time.** Don't combine unrelated sermon additions in a single pass.
6. **Verify every Scripture reference.** ESV only. Exact wording. No paraphrases presented as quotes. No "close enough."
7. **Verify every attributed quote.** If a quote is attributed to Spurgeon, confirm Spurgeon said it. If it cannot be verified, do not use it. The pulpit is not a place for misattribution.
8. **Leave things alone when risk outweighs benefit.** If an addition could dilute the text's message or distract from the passage, skip it. Say why you skipped it.
9. **Spot-check after changes.** After significant additions, reread the surrounding context to ensure flow and theological coherence.

## After Modifications

10. **Verify, then report.** Don't say "done" until you've confirmed the sermon reads correctly.
11. **Commit with honest messages.** Describe what was done AND what was intentionally left alone.
12. **Update the claude.md when needed.** If a new pattern, correction, or congregational insight emerges, document it for future sermons.

## What "Careful" Looks Like

- Reading a sermon file before editing it
- Verifying an ESV quote against the actual text before inserting it
- Confirming a historical quote is real and correctly attributed before using it
- Checking that a cross-reference actually supports the point being made
- Saying "I couldn't verify this quote, so I left it out" instead of guessing
- Committing after each logical unit of work, not batching everything at the end
- Admitting when a theological claim needs more research rather than asserting it
- Honoring the congregation by getting the details right

## What "Clever" Looks Like (Avoid)

- Inserting quotes based on memory without verifying them
- Assuming a verse says what you think it says without checking the ESV text
- Attributing a quote to Augustine (or anyone) without confirmation
- Batching dozens of unrelated sermon changes into one mega-commit
- Making "improvements" the user didn't ask for
- Adding theological claims without Scriptural grounding
- Silently skipping problems instead of reporting them
- Prioritizing sermon length or impressiveness over faithfulness to the text

## The Integrity Test

Before every commit, ask yourself:

1. **Is every Scripture reference verified?** Have I checked the ESV text, not just my memory?
2. **Is every attributed quote real?** Can I point to the source?
3. **Does this addition serve the text?** Or am I serving my own cleverness?
4. **Would this survive scrutiny from the congregation, from other pastors, from the Lord?**
5. **Did I leave anything silently wrong?** If I'm not sure, check.

## The Standard

The pulpit is sacred ground. A sermon carries the weight of "Thus says the Lord" — and that weight demands we handle the Word with fear, precision, and honesty.

We don't guess. We verify.
We don't assume. We check.
We don't cut corners. We serve the text.

A wrong quote dishonors the person misquoted.
A wrong verse reference dishonors the Word.
A clever shortcut dishonors the God we claim to serve.

## When This Skill Activates

This skill applies to EVERY sermon modification — every edit, every addition, every illustration, every quote. It serves as a persistent reminder that careful, verified, faithful work is always preferred over fast, clever, unverified work.

**This is not optional.** This guardrail exists because the work belongs to God, and He deserves our best — not our fastest.

**Soli Deo Gloria** — Excellence as worship means getting it right, not getting it fast.
