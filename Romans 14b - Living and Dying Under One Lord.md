# Romans 14:5-9 — Living and Dying Under One Lord

**Series**: Romans - The Night Is Far Gone
**Part V**: Walking in Daylight
**Text**: Romans 14:5-9 (ESV)

---

## Opening: The Book Arc

We are still walking in daylight.

The night is far gone. The alarm has sounded. We've been justified in the dark, dressed in Christ, assured of the dawn. And now, in these final chapters of Romans, Paul is showing us what it looks like to live as people of the day — even while the sun hasn't fully risen.

Last week we looked at the first four verses of Romans 14 — "The Welcome That Costs You Nothing." We saw that the church must receive those whom God has received. We saw that the strong must not despise the weak, and the weak must not judge the strong. We saw that God alone stands as Master over His servants.

Today Paul goes deeper.

He's not just telling us *how* to treat each other. He's telling us *why*. And the answer takes us all the way to the cross and the empty tomb.

If you've brought your Bible, and I hope you have, open with me to Romans 14:5-9.

## Prayer Transition

Before we dive in, let me tell you about a people group we're praying for.

The Koussountou people of Togo — 20,000 people, and as far as we know, not a single one of them follows Jesus. Zero percent evangelical. Zero percent Christian of any kind.

They're farmers and cattle herders. Their language is dying — linguists say few speakers will remain within a century. Their religion is Islam, but mixed with ancestor worship and spirit beliefs. They don't know which master they truly serve.

And here's the connection to Romans 14:

Paul says whether we live or die, we are the Lord's. But the Koussountou don't know who the Lord is. They're living and dying under false lords — Allah, the ancestors, the spirits.

They need what we have. They need to know that Christ died and rose to be Lord of the living and the dead — including them.

Let's pray for the Koussountou — that workers would go, that the gospel would be translated, that before their language dies, they would hear in their own tongue that Jesus is Lord.

Let's pray.

## Scripture Reading

Would someone read Romans 14:5-9 for us?

> "One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God. For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living."

## Introduction: From the Kitchen to the Cosmos

Notice what Paul does here.

He starts with the practical — days and food. The kind of things that divided the early church. Should we observe the Sabbath? Should we eat meat that might have been offered to idols? These were real questions for real Christians in Rome.

We have our own versions.

Should Christians send their kids to public school or homeschool? Should we watch that show? What about alcohol? What about how we vote? What about masks and vaccines and which candidates deserve our support?

These are real questions for real Christians in this room. And if we're honest, we've let some of them divide us in ways that Paul would not recognize as Christian.

But Paul doesn't stay there.

By the end of this passage, he's talking about life and death. About Christ dying and rising. About the Lordship of Jesus over everyone who has ever lived or ever will live.

This is Paul's method: he takes our small disputes and drowns them in the ocean of Christ's Lordship.

Your disagreement about secondary matters? It's real. But it's small compared to the reality that both of you — the one who observes and the one who doesn't — belong to the same risen Lord.

Romans 14 is not about lowering our convictions. It's about raising our eyes.

## I. Be Fully Convinced (v. 5)

Verse 5:

> "One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind."

Here Paul introduces a new example — days. Some in Rome believed certain days were sacred. Perhaps the Sabbath. Perhaps Jewish feast days. Others considered every day alike — no special religious observance required.

And Paul doesn't tell them to split the difference.

He says: *Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.*

This is not relativism.

Paul is not saying, "Believe whatever you want — it doesn't matter." He's already made clear that some things *do* matter. In Galatians, he pronounced curses on those who preached another gospel. In Romans 1-3, he laid out the universal guilt of humanity. In Romans 6, he declared that we must not continue in sin. Paul is no relativist.

But here, in matters of conscience where Scripture has not clearly spoken, Paul says: *Have convictions. Hold them. Be persuaded.*

The word is *plērophoreō* — to be fully assured, completely certain in your own thinking.

This is striking. In a passage about unity, Paul doesn't say "hold your convictions loosely." He says hold them firmly — but hold them as *your* convictions before *your* Lord.

The problem in Rome wasn't that people had convictions. The problem was that they were imposing their convictions on others as if they were the standard.

You can be fully convinced in your own mind and still recognize that your brother, who is also fully convinced, answers to the same Lord you do.

Conviction without humility becomes tyranny.
Humility without conviction becomes spinelessness.

Paul wants both: strong convictions, held humbly before God.

## II. Everything for the Lord (v. 6)

Verse 6:

> "The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God."

This is remarkable.

Paul looks at two people doing opposite things — one observing a day, one not; one eating, one abstaining — and he says the same thing about both of them: *They're doing it for the Lord.*

Both give thanks. Both honor God. Both are motivated by faith.

The question isn't *what* you do. The question is *for whom* you do it.

This cuts against the legalist and the libertine.

The legalist says, "My practice is the only God-honoring practice." Paul says no — your brother who does the opposite is also honoring God.

The libertine says, "It doesn't matter what I do." Paul says no — it matters very much *why* you do it. Are you doing it for the Lord, with thanksgiving? Or are you doing it for yourself?

The motive sanctifies the action — or condemns it.

Two people eating meat. One is honoring the Lord with thanksgiving. The other is flaunting liberty to prove a point. Same action, different hearts, different verdicts.

Two people abstaining from meat. One is honoring the Lord according to conscience. The other is trying to earn God's favor by works. Same action, different hearts, different verdicts.

And let me say a word to those in recovery.

Some of you abstain not from weakness, but from wisdom. You've learned — through pain, through failure, through the wreckage of years you'd rather forget — that certain things are not safe for you. Your abstinence is not timidity. It is hard-won conviction, forged in the fires of your own history.

That's not weakness. That's faithfulness.

And when you abstain with thanksgiving — thanking God for your sobriety, thanking God for another day of freedom — you are honoring the Lord just as much as the brother who can partake freely. Maybe more. Because you know what it cost you to get here.

Don't let anyone make you feel inferior for your convictions. And don't judge those who don't share your story. They have their own battles.

God sees the heart.

This is why Paul will say later, in verse 23: "Whatever does not proceed from faith is sin." The issue isn't the calendar or the menu. The issue is faith.

## III. None of Us Lives to Himself (v. 7)

Verse 7:

> "For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself."

This is one of the most countercultural sentences in the New Testament.

Our world is built on autonomy. My body, my choice. My truth, my life. I answer to no one. I am my own.

Paul says: *None of us lives to himself.*

You are not your own. You were bought with a price. You belong to Another.

Paul said the same thing to the Corinthians:

> "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body." (1 Corinthians 6:19-20)

The men in our Bible study are working through total depravity right now. Here's where it lands: "None of us lives to himself" is not just a moral instruction — it's a theological reality. You never belonged to yourself. You were either a slave to sin or a servant of Christ. There is no third option. Autonomy is a myth. You have always been owned — the only question is by whom.

This applies in marriage.

Husbands, wives — you do not live to yourself. Your preferences about how to spend money, how to discipline the kids, how much screen time is acceptable, what church activities to attend, what food to put on the table — these are not hills to die on. These are disputable matters in your own household.

And Paul's word to the church applies in your living room: be fully convinced in your own mind, do everything for the Lord — but recognize that your spouse is also doing it for the Lord, and neither of you gets to play God over the other.

Some of the coldest wars in a marriage are fought over secondary things. You're not battling over the gospel. You're battling over the thermostat, the calendar, the in-laws. And in those battles, remember: none of us lives to himself. Your spouse doesn't exist to serve your preferences. You both exist to serve the Lord — together.

This applies to the strong:

You may have liberty in Christ to eat and drink and disregard certain days. But you do not have liberty to live as if your choices don't affect anyone else. You are not an island. Your freedom is not absolute. You live in a body — the body of Christ — and what you do ripples through that body.

This applies to the weak:

You may have convictions that bind your conscience. But you do not have the authority to bind your brother's conscience. You are not the Lord. Your scruples are not Scripture. You live under the same Master as your brother, and you do not get to play God with his life.

None of us lives to himself.

In life — we are accountable.
In death — we are still not our own.

This is not oppression. This is freedom.

Because if I am my own, then my life depends on me. My meaning depends on me. My security depends on me. And I will fail.

But if I am the Lord's — then my life rests in His hands. My meaning comes from His purposes. My security is grounded in His finished work.

To belong to Christ is to be free from the tyranny of self.

## IV. Whether We Live or Die (v. 8)

Verse 8:

> "For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's."

This is one of the most comforting verses in all of Scripture.

*Whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.*

In life — you belong to Christ.

Every breath you take is borrowed from Him. Every morning you wake is His gift. Every day you walk through this world, you walk as His possession, His servant, His beloved.

In death — you still belong to Christ.

Death does not sever you from Christ. Death does not transfer ownership. Death does not end the relationship. When you close your eyes for the last time, you do not cease to be the Lord's. You enter more fully into His presence.

Paul said the same thing in Romans 8:38-39:

> "For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."

Death is in that list. And death cannot separate you from Christ.

This is why the Heidelberg Catechism begins with that famous question:

> **Q. What is your only comfort in life and in death?**
>
> **A. That I am not my own, but belong — body and soul, in life and in death — to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ. He has fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood, and has delivered me from the tyranny of the devil. He also watches over me in such a way that not a hair can fall from my head without the will of my Father in heaven; in fact, all things must work together for my salvation. Because I belong to him, Christ, by his Holy Spirit, also assures me of eternal life and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready from now on to live for him.**

That answer is Romans 14:8 unpacked.

*I am not my own.* — "None of us lives to himself."
*I belong — body and soul, in life and in death.* — "Whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's."
*To my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.* — "Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord."

This is not a burden. This is the ground beneath your feet.

You are not adrift. You are not alone. You are not meaningless. You belong to the Lord — in life, in death, and forever.

## V. Christ Died and Rose to Be Lord (v. 9)

Verse 9:

> "For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living."

Here is the foundation.

Why does Christ have the right to be your Lord in life and death? Because He died and rose again.

His Lordship is not arbitrary. It is not imposed from outside. It is earned — purchased by His own blood, vindicated by His resurrection.

Christ entered death. He tasted death. He conquered death. And He came out the other side as Lord over all who have ever died and all who are still living.

This is the theological ground of everything Paul has been saying.

Why should you welcome your brother who disagrees with you on secondary matters? Because you both belong to the same Lord who died and rose for both of you.

Why should you not judge your brother's servant? Because there is only one Master — and He proved His right to that title by dying and rising.

Why does it not matter whether you eat or abstain, observe or don't observe, as long as you do it for the Lord? Because the Lord is the one who died and rose, and His Lordship covers every domain of life and death.

Christ's death and resurrection is not just the ground of your salvation. It is the ground of your unity. It is the ground of your ethics. It is the ground of your comfort in the face of death.

And here's where election meets unity: the men's study is moving into unconditional election next week. Consider this — we are the Lord's. Not because we earned it. Not because we figured out the right position on every disputable matter. We are His because He chose us, unconditionally. The weak brother who frustrates you? God chose him. The strong brother who offends you? God chose him too. Election levels the playing field. You cannot look down on someone whom God looked upon in eternity past and said, "Mine."

Everything Paul says in Romans 14 flows from this: *Christ died and lived again.*

## Pastoral Landing

### To the One Obsessed with Being Right

You've been arguing about secondary things as if your soul depended on it.

It doesn't.

Your soul depends on Christ — and so does your brother's. The same Lord who died for you died for him. The same resurrection that secures your future secures his.

Maybe it's time to stop fighting and start worshiping the Lord you both belong to.

### To the One Facing Health Battles

Some of you are sitting in this room with a diagnosis. Or waiting for test results. Or watching someone you love fade.

The numbers keep you awake. The uncertainty is crushing. You've Googled too much and prayed too little, or prayed desperately and heard only silence.

Hear verse 8 again — slowly this time:

*If we live, we live to the Lord. And if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.*

Paul doesn't promise you healing. He doesn't promise long life. He promises something better: *You cannot fall out of the Lord's hands.*

If you live — if the treatment works, if the scan comes back clear, if you get more years than you expected — you will live those years belonging to Him. They will not be wasted. They will be His.

And if you die — if this is the valley, if this body fails — you will die belonging to Him. Death is not a thief breaking into the Lord's house. Death is a doorway through which the Lord Himself will carry you.

Christ died and rose to be Lord of the dead and the living. He has been where you're going. And He came back. That's not theology for healthy people. That's oxygen for the suffocating.

You are not walking toward darkness. You are walking toward the dawn.

### To the One Who Has Lost Someone

The grief is real. The absence is brutal. The silence where their voice used to be — it's deafening.

But if they belonged to Christ, they still do. Christ is Lord of the dead and the living. They have not ceased to exist. They have not ceased to be His. They are with Him now — more fully, more consciously, more joyfully than they ever were here.

And one day, in the resurrection, you will see them again. Not as strangers, but as fellow servants of the same Lord.

### To the One Whose Life Feels Meaningless

You wake up, go through the motions, and wonder what the point is. Nothing seems to matter. No one seems to need you.

Paul says: *None of us lives to himself.*

Your life is not your own to evaluate. Your meaning is not yours to determine. You belong to the Lord — and He has purposes for you that you cannot see.

The fact that you are still breathing means He is not done with you yet.

Live to Him. That's enough meaning for any life.

## Closing: The Lordship That Holds Everything Together

We are still walking in daylight.

And the light we walk in is not a principle or a program. It is a Person — the risen Lord Jesus Christ.

He died. He rose. He is Lord of the dead and the living.

The ladies studying Hosea know this story. God called Israel His own despite her adultery. "You are my people," He said — not because she was faithful, but because He is. That's what Paul means here: *We are the Lord's.* Not because we were worthy. Because He is gracious. The same God who pursued an unfaithful bride pursues us still.

And because He is Lord, we can hold our convictions firmly and our brothers gently. We can disagree on secondary things and remain united in the one thing that matters: we belong to Him.

Whether you observe days or don't. Whether you eat meat or abstain. Whether you live another fifty years or die tomorrow.

You are the Lord's.

That's not a leash. That's an anchor.

Let's pray.
