## Opening: The Arc of Romans

We've come a long way in this letter.

Remember where we started? Romans 1-3. The mirror. Paul held it up and showed us what we looked like — Jew and Gentile alike, religious and irreligious, moral and immoral. "None is righteous, no, not one." Every mouth stopped. The whole world held accountable to God.

That was the bad news. And it was very bad.

Then came the good news. Romans 3:21 — "But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law." Justification by faith. Union with Christ. No condemnation. Nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

We looked in the mirror. We saw ourselves guilty. Then we were hidden in Christ.

Now Paul asks a question that should stop us cold:

In light of all that — who do you think you are?

## Prayer Transition

Before we read the text, let me tell you about a people group we're praying for.

The Giddikki people of India — 72,000 of them. Zero percent Christian. Zero percent evangelical. Not a single known believer.

They were historically fortune-tellers — people who claimed to read the future for others. Today most of them sell aluminum utensils and plastic boxes at markets, or work as day laborers. They worship Hindu deities — Durga, Lakshmi, Eswara. They have their own community council, the *latikuta*, where disputes are settled and judgments are rendered.

They have a judgment seat. But they don't know about *the* judgment seat.

And here's the connection to Romans 14: Paul says every knee will bow. Every tongue will confess. That includes the Giddikki. One day, the fortune-tellers who claimed to know the future will stand before the One who holds it. And the Bible is already translated into their language — Konkani. The Jesus Film is available. The tools exist. What's missing are the workers.

Let's pray for the Giddikki — that the gospel would reach them, that someone would go, that the people who once told fortunes would come to know the One who tells the truth: Jesus Christ is Lord.

Let's pray.

## Scripture Reading

Would someone read Romans 14:10-12 for us?

> "Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God; for it is written, 'As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.' So then each of us will give an account of himself to God."

## Introduction: Two Questions That Sting

Paul asks two questions. And they're not the same question.

"Why do you pass judgment on your brother?"

That's aimed at the weak — the one with the stricter conscience, the one who abstains, the one who sees his brother's freedom and concludes he must not be serious about holiness.

"Why do you despise your brother?"

That's aimed at the strong — the one with the liberated conscience, the one who eats and drinks freely, the one who looks at his brother's scruples and rolls his eyes. *He's so uptight. He doesn't get grace.*

Both are sins. Both are named. Neither gets a pass.

The weak tends to *judge* — to condemn, to question the other's salvation, to treat secondary matters as gospel tests.

The strong tends to *despise* — to look down, to dismiss, to treat the weaker brother as an obstacle to mature Christianity.

And Paul says: *Why?*

Why are you doing this? Don't you know where this is heading?

## I. You Are Not the Judge (v. 10b)

"For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God."

The word is *bēma* — the judgment seat. In the Roman world, this was the raised platform where cases were tried, where verdicts were rendered, where the magistrate sat in authority.

Paul uses the same word in 2 Corinthians 5:10:

> "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil."

Here's the logic: There is a Judge. It's not you.

You are not qualified to sit on that seat. You don't have the wisdom. You don't have the righteousness. You don't have the authority.

You looked in the mirror in Romans 1-3. You saw yourself guilty — just as guilty as the brother you're now judging. You were saved by grace — the same grace that saved the brother you're now despising.

And now you want to climb up on the *bēma* and render verdicts?

You're not the Judge. You're a fellow defendant who got pardoned.

Act like it.

And let me say this gently: the judgment seat also applies to how we read Scripture.

Some Christians act as though the church began with them — as though no one before their generation understood the Bible correctly. They reject creeds and confessions, not because they've examined them and found them wanting, but because they assume their own reading of Scripture is self-evidently superior to twenty centuries of Christian reflection.

That's not humility. That's a different kind of judgment seat — one where you sit and everyone who came before you stands accused.

The Reformers didn't reject church history. They engaged it. They stood on the shoulders of Augustine and the church fathers even as they corrected Rome's errors. They gave us confessions — not to replace Scripture, but to summarize and protect what Scripture teaches.

"No creed but Christ" sounds humble. But it often means: "No accountability but myself."

And Paul says: there is a judgment seat. And you're not sitting on it.

## II. Every Knee Will Bow (v. 11)

Paul quotes Isaiah 45:23:

> "As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God."

This is staggering.

In Isaiah, this is spoken by YHWH — the covenant God of Israel. It's a declaration of His absolute sovereignty over all nations. Every knee — Jew and Gentile, slave and free, king and commoner — will bow before Him.

And Paul applies this to the judgment seat of Christ.

The same Lord who died and rose to be Lord of the living and the dead (14:9) is the Lord before whom every knee will bow.

Think about what this means for the church:

The brother you're judging? He will bow beside you.
The sister you're despising? She will confess beside you.
The person whose convictions annoy you? They will stand before the same Lord you will.

And here's the thing: when you're on your knees before the risen Christ, you're not going to be thinking about whether your brother ate meat or observed a day. You're going to be overwhelmed by the glory of the One who saved you.

Every knee. Every tongue. No exceptions.

---

## III. Every Tongue Will Confess (v. 11b)

"Every tongue shall confess to God."

The word is *exomologeō* — to acknowledge openly, to declare, to confess.

This is not forced submission. This is recognition. This is every creature finally acknowledging what has always been true: Jesus Christ is Lord.

Paul quotes this same verse in Philippians 2:10-11:

> "...at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."

Every tongue. Every language. Every tribe. Every nation.

The Koussountou of Togo will confess. The businessman in Manhattan will confess. The prisoner in solitary confinement will confess. The pastor and the atheist, the strong and the weak, the one who observed the day and the one who didn't.

All of them — all of us — will stand before Christ and acknowledge His Lordship.

And in that moment, our petty disputes over secondary matters will look exactly as small as they are.

---

## IV. Each of Us — Himself (v. 12)

"So then each of us will give an account of himself to God."

Notice: *himself*.

Not of your brother. Not of your spouse. Not of your pastor. Not of your parents. Not of the person in this room whose choices bother you most.

You will give an account of *yourself*.

That's enough to keep you busy.

You will not be asked: "Why did your brother eat meat?"
You will be asked: "Why did you despise him for it?"

You will not be asked: "Why did your sister observe that day?"
You will be asked: "Why did you judge her for it?"

The standard isn't whether you were right about the secondary issue. The standard is whether you loved your brother while you disagreed with him.

This should produce two things in us:

**Humility** — because we know we will stand before the Judge ourselves. We have plenty to answer for without adding "played judge over my brother" to the list.

**Freedom** — because we don't have to carry the burden of being everyone else's conscience. That's God's job, not ours. We can release our brothers and sisters to the Lord who bought them.

## Naming What Must Be Named

Now, let me be direct about something.

Everything Paul says here applies to genuine disputable matters — food, days, practices where Scripture has not clearly spoken.

But some things are not disputable. Some things are not matters of conscience. Some things are sin masquerading as conviction.

And one of the most insidious errors creeping into some corners of the church today is kinism — the repackaged racism that tries to use Scripture to justify ethnic separation and superiority.

Let me be absolutely clear: kinism is not a secondary issue. It is not a disputable matter. It is an abomination.

It takes the gospel that tears down the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile and rebuilds that wall with pseudo-biblical bricks.

It takes the church that is "one body" — where "there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free" — and fractures it along ethnic lines.

It takes the vision of Revelation 7 — "a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne" — and says, "Not in my church. Not at my table."

This is not the weak brother with scruples about meat. This is the wolf in sheep's clothing.

And Paul's question — "Why do you despise your brother?" — lands with devastating force on anyone who would despise a brother because of the color of his skin.

You will stand before the judgment seat of Christ. And so will the brother you despised. And Christ will not ask what nation you came from. He will ask whether you loved the brothers He died for.

Every knee will bow. Every tribe. Every tongue. Every nation. Together.

If you can't worship with your brother now, what makes you think you'll be ready for eternity?

## Pastoral Landing

### To the One Who Keeps Score on Others

You've been watching. Keeping a mental list. Cataloging every questionable choice, every secondary disagreement, every way your brother falls short of your standard.

Put down the clipboard. You're not the Judge.

You will give an account of *yourself*. That's enough. Let your brother answer to his Lord — and focus on answering to yours.

### To the One Exhausted by Being Judged

You're tired. Every choice you make gets scrutinized. Every decision gets questioned. You feel like you can't breathe without someone weighing in on whether it was the "right" kind of breath.

Hear this: You answer to Christ. Not to them.

Their judgment of you is not the final word. The judgment seat of God is. And the One who sits on that seat already died for you.

You are free. Live like it.

### To the One Afraid of Judgment

The thought of standing before God terrifies you. You know your sin. You know your failures. You know that if God gave you what you deserved, you would be lost.

But here's the gospel: the Judge has already rendered His verdict — and it was rendered at the cross.

"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1).

You will stand before the judgment seat. But you will not stand alone. You will stand in Christ — hidden in the One who already bore your judgment.

The *bēma* is not a threat to those in Christ. It is a homecoming.

### To the One Who Has Forgotten Accountability

Maybe you've swung the other direction. You've heard "don't judge" so many times that you've forgotten accountability exists at all.

Paul brings it back: "Each of us will give an account of himself to God."

Grace is not license. Freedom is not lawlessness. You will answer to Christ for how you lived, how you loved, how you used the freedom He bought for you.

That's not bad news. That's sobriety. That's weight. That's the gravity that keeps grace from becoming cheap.

## Closing: The Judgment That Ends All Judging

We are still walking in daylight.

And in the light, we see clearly: there is one Judge, and it's not us.

We looked in the mirror. We saw ourselves guilty.
We were hidden in Christ. We were saved by grace.
And now Paul asks: In light of all that — who are you to judge?

Every knee will bow. Including yours. Including your brother's.
Every tongue will confess. Including yours. Including his.
Each of us will give an account. Of ourselves. Not of each other.

So put down the gavel. Release your brother to the Lord who bought him. And prepare to give an account of how *you* lived — how you loved — how you walked in the daylight.

The judgment seat of Christ is coming.

And it will end all our petty judging forever.

Let's pray.
